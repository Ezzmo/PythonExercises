Setting up a virtual environment and conducting tests:
Inside the relevant git repository (clone it), create applications and tests folders
Initialise both folders as packages
Install a virtual environment
Create a .gitignore file
Activate the virtual environment to work from it
Pip install pytest and pytest-cov
This now includes all requirements needed to test
Pip freeze > requirements.txt: this creates the version list so that the environment can be recreated.
Edit the .gitignore accordingly, so that pushing up this environment only includes the necessary files.
The necessary files are the applications, tests, .gitignore and requirements. Pytest also creates cache files within the tests and applications folder, add those to .gitignore 
The git repository is now ready for anyone to clone and conduct the tests.
